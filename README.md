Developed this website for Pimpri Chinchwad College Of Engineering's TedX event.
Its a basic Todo list but added functionalities to track the tasks on the day of the event.
Once a task is assigned to a volunteer, change the color of the task to orange by clicking on the task.
When the task is completed again click on the task and it turns green meaning task is successfully completed.
new tasks can be added and existing ones can be deleted at runtime.
